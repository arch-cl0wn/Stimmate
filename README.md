# StimMate

StimMate is an innovative solution developed by our team of neurodivergent individuals, addressing challenges faced by the neurodivergent community in managing stimming behaviours. Our app offers a TensorFlow-based recommender system suggesting healthy and effective stimming habits, with habit-tracking features to monitor progress.

## About The Project

  

### What is Our Problem?

  

Neurodivergent individuals often engage in stimming - a self-soothing behavior that helps them manage sensory overload, anxiety, and other challenges. However, some stimming habits can be harmful or disruptive, creating an urgent need to address this issue and support the well-being of the neurodivergent community.

  

### What is Our Solution?

  

StimMate offers a personalized recommender system suggesting healthy and effective stimming habits. The app is built using Flutter in the frontend and Firebase in the backend, providing a seamless user experience. With habit tracking features, users can monitor their stimming habits regularly and even generate reports sharable with mental health providers for a comprehensive understanding of stimming patterns.

  

### Why You Should Choose Us?

  

Our team consists of neurodivergent individuals who have firsthand experience with the challenges faced by the neurodivergent community. We have designed StimMate to cater specifically to the needs of neurodivergent users, incorporating suggestions from psychologists and psychiatrists to create an effective assistive tool. Our solution is built using Google's TensorFlow, Flutter, Firebase, and WearOS technologies, ensuring a robust and scalable app that can grow to accommodate an expanding user base.

  

## Our SDGs

  
  

Our project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

### The Story of StimMate

  

As a team of neurodivergent individuals, we were inspired to create StimMate based on our own experiences and the need for a supportive tool in managing stimming behaviors. Our journey began with identifying the problem, and we then utilized our collective expertise and consulted mental health professionals to design and develop the app.

  

## Future Plans with WearOS

  

We plan to integrate WearOS smartwatch capabilities into our app, allowing users to track stims more accurately on-the-go. This integration will improve stim recommendations and reporting accuracy while providing a seamless user experience.
